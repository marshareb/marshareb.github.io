I am a student of [Andrey Gogolev](https://people.math.osu.edu/gogolyev.1/) and a second year graduate student at Ohio State University in Mathematics.

### Research Interests

My interests now are in smooth dynamics. I'm currently interested in rigidity results, like those seen in [Otal](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1971511), [Croke](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.598.7548&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and [Guillemin-Kazhdan](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82780825.pdf) (see also [here](https://marshareb.github.io/GK/)).
