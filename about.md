I am a first year graduate student at Ohio State University in Mathematics. While my passion is in studying pure math, I also enjoy teaching and mentoring other students. I've been a tutor for the past five years and I've been a TA for the past two years, with responsibilities ranging from grading to teaching a class. Currently, I am on a fellowship and am not teaching. I also dabble in programming, having developed a variety of programs to automate things in my life. I also enjoy sushi and board games in my free time.

### Research Interests

My interests as of now are in Geometric Group Theory and Dynamics, though this is subject to me learning more.
