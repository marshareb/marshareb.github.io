I am a third year mathematics graduate student at Ohio State University. My advisor is [Andrey Gogolev](https://people.math.osu.edu/gogolyev.1/).

### Research Interests

I'm currently interested in rigidity results like those seen in [Otal](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1971511), [Croke](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.598.7548&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and [Guillemin-Kazhdan](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82780825.pdf) (see also [here](https://marshareb.github.io/GK/)).
