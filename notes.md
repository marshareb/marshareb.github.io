Here are a collection of notes I've written over the years. Many are incomplete, and will maybe eventually be finished or rewritten entirely. They are of varying quality, as I've grown both as a mathematician and a writer. I've drawn heavily from different lectures/texts over the years. If you have any issues with anything you see, please contact me and I will take it down/change it.
