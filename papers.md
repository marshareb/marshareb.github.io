<h3><a class = "link-style" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10882"> A counterexample to marked length spectrum semi-rigidity (with Andrey Gogolev)</a> [2024] </h3>
<p> Given a closed orientable negatively curved Riemannian surface, we show how to construct a perturbation such that each closed geodesic becomes longer, and yet there is no diffeomorphism which contracts every tangent vector. To appear in <em>Groups, Geometry, and Dynamics</em>.</p>

<p> Using the notion of magnetic curvature recently introduced by the first author, we extend E. Hopf's theorem to the setting of magnetic systems and study the notion of "magnetic flatness." To appear in <em>Communications in Mathematical Physics</em>.   </p>

<h3><a class = "link-style" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01372"> A positive proportion Livshits theorem (with Caleb Dilsavor)</a> [2024] </h3>
<p> A generalization of the Livshits theorem using statistical information on orbits. <em>Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society</em>, (152) 11, 4729 - 4744 (2024). </p>

<h3> <a class= "link-style" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07444">Codazzi tensor fields in reductive homogeneous spaces (with Ivo Terek)</a> [2023] </h3>
