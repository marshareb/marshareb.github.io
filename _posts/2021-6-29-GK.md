In this post, I discuss a "different" approach to the proof of Guillemin-Kazhdan.

# Introduction

The goal of this article is to try to give a slightly different approach to [Guillemin-Khazhdan's](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82780825.pdf) isospectral result. This will most likely fall somewhere in-between what is in the prior paper and what [Merry and Paternain](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~gpp24/ipgd(3).pdf) have. The main difference is that we assume a different condition for the surfaces to be isospectral. Using Feldman-Ornstein, we're able to get this assumption from GK's assumption. If we assume a little more (i.e. we follow Otal's proof ala [Wilkinson's notes](http://www.math.utah.edu/pcmi12/lecture_notes/wilkinson.pdf)) then we can actually deduce that the conjugacies are the isometries, however this is a little bit silly since if we're assuming Otal's strategy then we can get a much stronger result. We will settle for just finding some family of isometries here.

# Result

To start, fix a closed orientable surface $$M$$ along with a metric $$g$$. Together, these induce the geodesic flow in the following way: Let $$H : TM \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ be the Hamiltonian defined by

$$H(x,v) := g_x(v,v)^2,$$

and let $$\omega$$ be the canonical symplectic form pushed onto $$TM$$ via the musical isomorphism. Then we there is a vector field $$F$$ so that

$$i_F(\omega) = dH,$$

and this vector field generates the geodesic flow, once we restrict it to an energy surface (in the case of geodesic flow, like the magnetic flow, we assume that the energy surface is the unit tangent bundle). Recall from the [prior post](https://marshareb.github.io/Magnetic_Flows/) we have that the flow will be a constant of motion for the Hamiltonian. We will sometimes denote the geodesic flow generated by the vector field $$F$$ as $$(M,g)$$.

Assume we have a smooth family of metrics $$\{g_s\}$$, and along with this a family of unit tangent bundles $$S_sM$$. From these, we get corresponding geodesic flows $$\phi_s^t = (M,g_s) : S_sM \rightarrow S_sM$$, and assume that along with these we have a smooth family of $$C^0$$-conjugacies $$\{h_s : S_0M \rightarrow S_sM\}$$. The first observation to make is that these conjugacies preserve lengths of corresponding orbits. Namely if we have a closed orbit for $$\phi_0^t$$, say $$\gamma_0 : [0,T] \rightarrow M$$, and we let $$\gamma_s = h_s(\gamma_0)$$. The claim is that

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} L_{g_s}(\gamma_s) = \frac{\partial}{\partial s}\int_0^T (g_s)_{\gamma_s(t)}(\dot{\gamma}_s(t), \dot{\gamma}_s(t))dt = 0.$$

To see this, observe that $$H_s(\phi_s^t) = 1$$ for all $$s, t$$, so

$$ L_{g_s}(\gamma_s) = \int_0^T \sqrt{H_s(\phi_s^t)}dt = T.$$

In fact, we can use the same logic to deduce that

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \int_0^T H_s(\gamma_s, \dot{\gamma}_s)dt = 0.$$

Now, with this in mind, use the fact that $$H_s$$ is a smooth family of Hamiltonians and write

$$H_s = H_0 + s \dot{H} + O(s^2),$$

where

$$\dot{H} = \frac{\partial H_s}{\partial s} \bigg|_{s=0}.$$

Then

$$ 0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \int_0^T [H_0(\gamma_s, \dot{\gamma}_s) + s H_s(\gamma_s, \dot{\gamma}_s) + O(s^2)]dt \bigg|_{s=0}.$$

Bringing the derivative inside, we're left with

$$ 0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \int_0^T H_0(\gamma_s, \dot{\gamma}_s)dt + \int_0^T \dot{H}(\gamma_0, \dot{\gamma}_0)dt.$$

By a variational argument, we see that the term on the left is $$0$$. Thus we're left with

$$ 0 = \int_0^T \dot{H}(\gamma_0, \dot{\gamma}_0)dt,$$

where $$\gamma$$ is any closed orbit for $$(M,g_0)$$. By [Livschitz's theorem](https://marshareb.github.io/files/cohomologicalequations.pdf), we find that this implies there is some $$u$$ so that

$$X(u) = \dot{H}.$$

Now the question is to figure out what $$u$$ is. We again use the moving frame $$\{X,H,V\}$$ that we used in the [prior post](https://marshareb.github.io/Magnetic_Flows/). Recall it has the following properties (here quoting [GK](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82780825.pdf)):
(1) $$[V, X] = H,$$
(2) $$[V,H] = -X,$$
(3) $$[X,H] = KV.$$

It is not so hard to prove that we can decompose $$L^2(SM, \mathbb{C})$$ into a direct sum of subspaces $$H_m$$ which consist of functions $$ f: SM \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$$ satisfying

$$V(f) = imf,$$

this is the contents of **Lemma 3.1** in [GK](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82780825.pdf). Thus we write

$$L^2(SM, \mathbb{C}) = \bigoplus_{m \in \mathbb{Z}} H_m.$$

Along with this, we define operators

$$\eta^+ := \frac{X + iH}{2}, \ \ \eta^- := \frac{X-iH}{2}.$$

We claim that these are maps $$\eta^+ : H_m \rightarrow H_{m-1}$$ and $$\eta^- : H_m \rightarrow H_{m+1}.$$ First, observe that

$$\eta^+ + \eta^- = X,$$

$$\eta^+ - \eta^- = iH.$$

Hence

$$ [\eta^+, V] + [\eta^-, V] = [\eta^+ + \eta^-, V] = [X,V] = -H,$$

$$ [\eta^+, V] - [\eta^-, V] = [\eta^+ - \eta^-, V] = i[H,V] = iX,$$

So

$$[\eta^+,V] = \frac{1}{2}(iX - H) = i\left( \frac{X + iH}{2}\right) = i \eta^+,$$

$$[\eta^-, V] = \frac{1}{2}(-H - iX) = -i\left(\frac{X - iH}{2}\right) = -i \eta^-.$$

Now:

$$ [\eta^+, V] (f) = \eta^+ V(f) - V \eta^+(f) \implies V \eta^+(f) = \eta^+ V(f) - [\eta^+, v] (f)$$

$$ = im \eta^+(f) - i \eta^+(f) = i(m-1) \eta^+(f).$$

Thus $$\eta^+(f) \in H_{m-1},$$ and the same argument goes to show that $$\eta^-(f) \in H_{m+1}.$$ GK then goes on to show that these operators satisfy some nice properties, the most important of which can be summarized in the following theorem.

**Theorem:** If $$p \in C^\infty(SM)$$ satisfies

$$ p = \sum_{|i| \leq N} p_i, \ \ p_i \in H_i$$

and $$X(q) = p$$ for some $$q \in C^\infty(SM)$$, then

$$q = \sum_{|i| \leq N-1} q_i, \ \ q_i \in H_i.$$

The moral of the story is that we can reduce the degree by $$1$$. The argument follows by some nice Fourier tricks to conclude that everything too big has to be $$0$$.

The next thing to note at this point is that $$\cdot{H} \in H_{-2} \oplus H_0 \oplus H_2,$$ with $$\overline{H_{2}} = H_{-2}$$ and $$\overline{H_0} = H_0.$$  This follows by observing that $$\cdot{H}$$ is a symmetric $$2$$-tensor. Using this observation, we see that $$u$$ must be of the form $$u = u_{-1} + u_1.$$ In other words, we get that $$u$$ must be a $$1$$-form (in fact, a smooth $$1$$-form). When something like this happens, we call the symmetric 2-tensor **potential** with potential given by the $$1$$-form.

By varying, we see that $$\cdot{H}_s$$ satisfies all of the above criteria; moreover, $$\beta_s = \frac{\partial \|\cdot\|_t}{\partial t} \big|_{t=s}$$ satisfies the criteria as well. Assuming we have a potential symmetric $$2$$-tensor, the question is now whether we can find a family of homeomorphisms $$\{f_s\}$$ so that $$f_s^*(g_0) = g_s.$$ The trick is to use the duality given by our metric; we can find a vector field $$Z_s$$ which satisfies the condition that

$$ u_s(x, v) = (g_s)_x(Z_s(x), v).$$

Then $$Z_s$$ is a smooth vector field (since the $$1$$-form is smooth) which depends smoothly on $$s$$ (thus a time-dependent vector field). There is a map $$f_s$$ (also depending smoothly on $$s$$) so that

$$ Z_s = \frac{df_t}{dt} \bigg|_{t=s} (f_{s}^{-1}) \leftrightarrow  \frac{df_t}{dt} \bigg|_{t=s} = Z_s \circ f_s,$$

and moreover, $$f_0 = \text{Id}.$$ Let $$g_s' = f_s^*(g_0)$$ (correspondingly, $$\|\cdot\|_s' = f_s^*(\|\cdot\|_0)$$). Observe that we have the following:
(1) We have

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \|\cdot\|_s = 2 Z_s \|\cdot\|_0.  $$

(2) We have

$$ \frac{\partial }{\partial s} \|\cdot\|_s' = 2Z_s \|\cdot\|_0.$$

(3) We have

$$ \|\cdot\|_0' = \|\cdot\|_0.$$

**Remark:** By $$Z_s g_0,$$ we mean

$$ (Z_s \|\cdot\|_0)(x,v) = g_0(\nabla_v Z_s(x), v).$$

Thus both are solutions to the same IVP, and hence they are the same metric. We can conclude from here that we have

$$ \|\cdot\|_s = \|\cdot\|_s' = f^*(\|\cdot\|_0) \text{ for all } s,$$

so the metrics are isometric via the family $$f_s.$$ This proves the isospectral result!
