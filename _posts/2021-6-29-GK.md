In this post, I discuss a the proof of isospectral rigidty on negatively curved surfaces following the argument of Guillemin and Kazhdan.

# Introduction

The goal of this article is to discuss the proof of [Guillemin-Kazhdan's](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82780825.pdf) isospectral result (we abbreviate Guillemin-Kazhdan as GK). This will most likely fall somewhere in-between what is in the prior paper and what [Merry and Paternain](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~gpp24/ipgd(3).pdf) have. In the set up of the problem, we assume a slightly different condition than the usual one for isospectral rigidty. There are two ways I've seen this done:

1) Like in GK, one can say a family of metrics is isospectral if the eigenvalues [Laplace-Beltrami operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%E2%80%93Beltrami_operator) for the corresponding metrics are all the same.

2) A slightly different formulation (as discussed in [Grognet](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ergodic-theory-and-dynamical-systems/article/flots-magnetiques-en-courbure-negative/367C1356787B5F92F3C976BE84990D9B)) is that a family of metrics is isospectral if lengths of "corresponding" geodesics are the same. To be more precise, assume we have a family of metrics $$\{g_s\}$$ and corresponding geodesic flows $$\{\phi_s^t\}$$. Then the family is isospectral if there exists a smooth family of $$C^0$$-conjugacies $$\{h_s\}$$ conjugating $$\phi_s^t$$ and $$\phi_0^t$$ and also satisfying the property that $$h_0 = \text{Id}.$$

The goal of this article is to follow GK's argument using assumption (2) above. We make two observations on the above. First, using Feldman-Ornstein, we see that the $$C^0$$ condition is somewhat unnecessary since we can upgrade it to a $$C^\infty$$-conjugacy. Second, we observe that condition (2) implies that the marked length spectrum is the same between the metrics. Thus with a little more work (i.e. following Otal's proof ala [Wilkinson's notes](http://www.math.utah.edu/pcmi12/lecture_notes/wilkinson.pdf)) we can actually deduce that the conjugacies given are the isometries. One interesting question to explore is whether or not we can improve GK's argument to get something like Otal. That is, if we assume the family of conjugacies ahead of time, can we use this Fourier result to prove that the conjugacies are actually the isometries? It's not so clear that the argument will really work, but there's maybe a non-trivial trick we can do to adjust things. Note that the GK argument has the advantage of being "easily" generalized to higher dimensions, while Otal's result is still restricted to just surfaces.

In the following we're going to skim over some of the Fourier arguments. Hopefully in a later article I'll have a post covering not only this kind of Fourier argument, but the Fourier argument in general, and I'll also put in the context of Pestov's identity.

# GK Argument

We now prove the isospectral rigidty result. We first start by stating the theorem with all of the assumptions we'll be using.

**Theorem (GK):** Let $$M$$ be a closed orientable surface. Suppose we have a smooth family of metrics $$\{g_s\}$$ such that the corresponding geodesic flows $$\{\phi_s^t\}$$ are Anosov (i.e. we have negatice curvature). If we have a smooth family of $$C^0$$ maps $$\{h_s\}$$ with $$h_0 = \text{Id}$$ and which conjugate $$\phi_s^t$$ and $$\phi_0^t$$, then there exists a smooth family of diffeomorphisms $$\phi_s : M \rightarrow M$$ with $$\phi_s^*(g_0) = g_s$$ and $$\phi_0 = \text{Id}.$$

**Sketch of Proof:** To start, fix a closed orientable surface $$M$$ along with a metric $$g$$. Together these induce the geodesic flow in the following way: Let $$H : TM \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ be the Hamiltonian defined by

$$H(x,v) := g_x(v,v)^2,$$

and let $$\omega$$ be the canonical symplectic form pushed onto $$TM$$ via the musical isomorphism. Then we there is a vector field $$F$$ so that

$$i_F(\omega) = dH,$$

and this vector field generates the geodesic flow, once we restrict it to an energy surface (in the case of geodesic flow, like the magnetic flow, we assume that the energy surface is the unit tangent bundle). Recall from the [prior post](https://marshareb.github.io/Magnetic_Flows/) we have that the flow will be a constant of motion for the Hamiltonian. We will sometimes denote the geodesic flow generated by the vector field $$F$$ as $$(M,g)$$.

Assume we have a smooth family of metrics $$\{g_s\}$$, and along with this a family of unit tangent bundles $$S_sM$$. From these, we get corresponding geodesic flows $$\phi_s^t = (M,g_s) : S_sM \rightarrow S_sM$$, and assume that along with these we have a smooth family of $$C^0$$-conjugacies $$\{h_s : S_0M \rightarrow S_sM\}$$. The first observation to make is that these conjugacies preserve lengths of corresponding orbits. Namely if we have a closed orbit for $$\phi_0^t$$, say $$\gamma_0 : [0,T] \rightarrow M$$, and we let $$\gamma_s = h_s(\gamma_0)$$. The claim is that

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} L_{g_s}(\gamma_s) = \frac{\partial}{\partial s}\int_0^T (g_s)_{\gamma_s(t)}(\dot{\gamma}_s(t), \dot{\gamma}_s(t))dt = 0.$$

To see this, observe that $$H_s(\phi_s^t) = 1$$ for all $$s, t$$, so

$$ L_{g_s}(\gamma_s) = \int_0^T \sqrt{H_s(\phi_s^t)}dt = T.$$

In fact, we can use the same logic to deduce that

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \int_0^T H_s(\gamma_s, \dot{\gamma}_s)dt = 0.$$

Now, with this in mind, use the fact that $$H_s$$ is a smooth family of Hamiltonians and write

$$H_s = H_0 + s \dot{H} + O(s^2),$$

where

$$\dot{H} = \frac{\partial H_s}{\partial s} \bigg|_{s=0}.$$

Then

$$ 0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \int_0^T [H_0(\gamma_s, \dot{\gamma}_s) + s H_s(\gamma_s, \dot{\gamma}_s) + O(s^2)]dt \bigg|_{s=0}.$$

Bringing the derivative inside, we're left with

$$ 0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \int_0^T H_0(\gamma_s, \dot{\gamma}_s)dt + \int_0^T \dot{H}(\gamma_0, \dot{\gamma}_0)dt.$$

By a variational argument (see [these notes](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/terekcouto.1/texts/var_noether.pdf) for more info), we see that the term on the left is $$0$$. Thus we're left with

$$ 0 = \int_0^T \dot{H}(\gamma_0, \dot{\gamma}_0)dt,$$

where $$\gamma$$ is any closed orbit for $$(M,g_0)$$.

By [Livschitz's theorem](https://marshareb.github.io/files/cohomologicalequations.pdf), we find that this implies there is some $$u$$ so that

$$X(u) = \dot{H}.$$

Now the question is to figure out what $$u$$ is. We again use the moving frame $$\{X,H,V\}$$ that we used in the [prior post](https://marshareb.github.io/Magnetic_Flows/). Recall it has the following properties (here quoting [GK](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82780825.pdf)):

(1) $$[V, X] = H,$$

(2) $$[V,H] = -X,$$

(3) $$[X,H] = KV.$$

It is not so hard to prove that we can decompose $$L^2(SM, \mathbb{C})$$ into a direct sum of subspaces $$H_m$$ which consist of functions $$ f: SM \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$$ satisfying

$$V(f) = imf,$$

this is the contents of **Lemma 3.1** in [GK](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82780825.pdf). Thus we write

$$L^2(SM, \mathbb{C}) = \bigoplus_{m \in \mathbb{Z}} H_m.$$

Along with this, we define operators

$$\eta^+ := \frac{X + iH}{2}, \ \ \eta^- := \frac{X-iH}{2}.$$

We claim that these are maps $$\eta^+ : H_m \rightarrow H_{m-1}$$ and $$\eta^- : H_m \rightarrow H_{m+1}.$$ First, observe that

$$\eta^+ + \eta^- = X,$$

$$\eta^+ - \eta^- = iH.$$

Hence

$$ [\eta^+, V] + [\eta^-, V] = [\eta^+ + \eta^-, V] = [X,V] = -H,$$

$$ [\eta^+, V] - [\eta^-, V] = [\eta^+ - \eta^-, V] = i[H,V] = iX,$$

So

$$[\eta^+,V] = \frac{1}{2}(iX - H) = i\left( \frac{X + iH}{2}\right) = i \eta^+,$$

$$[\eta^-, V] = \frac{1}{2}(-H - iX) = -i\left(\frac{X - iH}{2}\right) = -i \eta^-.$$

Now:

$$ [\eta^+, V] (f) = \eta^+ V(f) - V \eta^+(f) \implies V \eta^+(f) = \eta^+ V(f) - [\eta^+, v] (f)$$

$$ = im \eta^+(f) - i \eta^+(f) = i(m-1) \eta^+(f).$$

Thus $$\eta^+(f) \in H_{m-1},$$ and the same argument goes to show that $$\eta^-(f) \in H_{m+1}.$$ GK then goes on to show that these operators satisfy some nice properties, the most important of which can be summarized in the following theorem.

**Theorem:** If $$p \in C^\infty(SM)$$ satisfies

$$ p = \sum_{|i| \leq N} p_i, \ \ p_i \in H_i$$

and $$X(q) = p$$ for some $$q \in C^\infty(SM)$$, then

$$q = \sum_{|i| \leq N-1} q_i, \ \ q_i \in H_i.$$

The moral of the story is that we can reduce the degree by $$1$$. The argument follows by some nice Fourier tricks to conclude that everything too big has to be $$0$$.

The next thing to note at this point is that $$\dot{H} \in H_{-2} \oplus H_0 \oplus H_2,$$ with $$\overline{\dot{H}_{2}} = \dot{H}_{-2}$$ and $$\overline{\dot{H}_0} = \dot{H}_0.$$  This follows by observing that $$\dot{H}$$ is a symmetric $$2$$-tensor, along with some observation on complex differentials (see Theorem 4.3 in GK). As a consequence of this, we can also deduce that $$u$$ must be a $$1$$-form (in fact, a smooth $$1$$-form). When something like this happens, we call the symmetric 2-tensor **potential** with potential given by the $$1$$-form. We'll generalize this term following [Croke and Sharafutdinov](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.598.7548&rep=rep1&type=pdf) to other flows and higher order functions. Suppose we had some Anosov flow with infinitesmal generator $$F$$ and a symmetric $$i$$-tensor $$f$$ along with some $$u \in C^\infty(SM, \mathbb{R})$$ such that $$F(u) = f$$. Then we call $$f$$ potential if $$u$$ is symmetric $$(i-1)$$-tensor. For the purposes of the GK argument, this is unnecessary, however as seen in the Croke and Sharafutdinov paper this idea is a specific example of much more general phenomena.

Let's now go back to the argument. We observe that the argument was not special to the case $$s=0$$, it was just convenient for notation. What really happens is we now have a family of symmetric $$2$$-tensors, $$\{\dot{H}_s\}$$, where

$$\dot{H}_s = \frac{\partial H_t}{\partial t}\bigg|_{t=s}.$$

We also have a family of geodesic flows, $$X_s$$, and corresponding operators $$\eta_s^+, \eta_s^-$$ which all vary smoothly with $$s$$. For each $$s$$, we have a solution $$u_s$$ to the equation

$$X_s(u_s) = \dot{H}_s.$$

Since everything is smooth (and the operators are **elliptic**), we get that these solutions also vary smoothly with respect to $$s$$. So we have a family of $$1$$-forms $$\{u_s\}$$ varying smoothly with respect to $$s$$. We're now going to diverge from GK again to make the argument a little nicer (we'll follow [Merry and Paternain](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~gpp24/ipgd(3).pdf)).

With respect to each $$1$$-form $$u_s$$ we can find a vector field $$Z_s$$ by setting $$Z_s = \hat{g}_s^{-1}(u_s)$$, where $$\hat{g}$$ is the musical isomorphism (equivalently, just view this as the vector field which is dual to $$u_s$$ under the metric). Let's fix $$s=0$$ for notational convenience. Fix $$(x,v) \in TM$$ and let $$\gamma$$ be the curve with $$\gamma(0) = x$$ and $$\dot{\gamma}(0) = v$$. Notice that we have

$$ X(u)(x,v) = \frac{d}{dt} u(\gamma(t), \dot{\gamma}(t)) \bigg|_{t=0} = \frac{d}{dt} g_{\gamma(t)}(Z(\gamma(t)), \dot{\gamma}(t)) \bigg|_{t=0}.$$

Using compatibility of the metric, we can bring this in to get

$$ \frac{d}{ds} (g_s)_x(v,v) \bigg|_{s=0} = \dot{H}(x,v) = X(u)(x,v) = 2 g_x (\nabla_v Z(x), v).$$

Moreover this holds for each $$s$$. Correspondingly, we can find a family of diffeomorphisms $$\phi_s$$ with $$\phi_0 = \text{Id}$$ and

$$ Z_s = \frac{d\phi_s}{ds} \circ \phi_s^{-1}.$$

For context, see [these lecture notes](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/Courses/16F-Manifolds/Notes/Lec24.pdf). It is a tedious calculation, but it is not so hard to show that this implies

$$ \frac{d}{ds} (g_s)_x(v,w) \bigg|_{s=0} = g_x(\nabla_v Z(x), w) + g_x(v, \nabla_w Z(x)).$$

Another tedious calculation also shows that

$$ g_x(\nabla_v Z(x), w) + g_x(v, \nabla_w Z(x)) = \frac{d}{ds} g_0(d\phi_s(v), d\phi_s(w)) \bigg|_{s=0}.$$

Thus letting things vary with $$s$$, let

$$ (\beta_s)_x(v,w) = \frac{d}{dt} (g_t)_x(v,w) \bigg|_{t=s}.$$

What we've established is that

$$ (\beta_s)_x(v,w) = (g_s)_x(\nabla_v Z_s(x), w) + (g_s)_x(v, \nabla_w Z_s(x)).$$

This is an alternative definition for a symmetric $$2$$-tensor to be potential (as per [Merry and Paternain](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~gpp24/ipgd(3).pdf)). The biggest takeaway from this is that we have

$$ \frac{d}{dt} \phi_t^*(g_0)_x(v,w) \bigg|_{t=s} = (g_s)_x(\nabla_v Z_s(x), w) + (g_s)_x(v, \nabla_w Z_s(x)) = \frac{d}{dt} (g_t)_x(v,w) \bigg|_{t=s}.$$

So if we let $$v=w$$, we get

$$ \frac{d}{dt} \phi_t^*(H_0)(x,v) \bigg|_{t=s} = 2(g_s)_x(\nabla_v Z_s(x), v)  = \frac{d}{dt} H_t(x,v) \bigg|_{t=s}.$$

Define the action of a vector field on the Hamiltonian $$H_s$$ by

$$Z_s(H_s)(x,v) = 2(g_s)_x(\nabla_v Z_s(x), v).$$

We see that

$$\frac{d}{ds} (H_s) = Z_s(H_s),$$

and if we define $$H_s'(x,v) = (\phi_s^*)(g_0)_x(v,v)$$, then

$$\frac{d}{ds} (H_s') = Z_s (H_s').$$

To see this last equation, take a curve $$\gamma$$ adapted to the point $$(x,v) \in TM.$$ Then

$$  
\begin{split}
\frac{d}{ds} H_s' = (\phi_s)^*(H_0)(x,v) = \frac{d}{ds} (g_0)( d\phi_s(v), d\phi_s(v)) \\
= \frac{d}{ds} (g_0)\left( \frac{d}{dt} (\phi_s \circ \gamma(t)), \frac{d}{dt} (\phi_s \circ \gamma(t))\right) \bigg|_{t=0} \\
= 2 (g_0)\left( \nabla_{\frac{d}{ds}}\frac{d}{dt} (\phi_s \circ \gamma(t)), \frac{d}{dt} (\phi_s \circ \gamma(t))\right) \bigg|_{t=0} \\
= 2 (g_0)\left( \nabla_{\frac{d}{dt}}\frac{d}{ds} (\phi_s \circ \gamma(t)), \frac{d}{dt} (\phi_s \circ \gamma(t))\right) \bigg|_{t=0} \\
= 2 (g_0)\left( \nabla_{d\phi_s(v)} Z_s(\phi_s(x)), d\phi_s(v) \right)  \\
= 2 \phi_s^*(g_0)(\nabla_v Z_s(x), v) = Z_s(H_s')(x,v).
\end{split}
$$

We see both of these satisfy the same differential equation, and furthermore we see that they have the same initial condition:

$$ H_0' = H_0.$$

Thus we have that $$H_s' = H_s$$ for all $$s$$. If we let $$g_s' = \phi_s^*(g_0)$$, then this says that for all $$(x,v) \in TM$$ we have

$$ (g_s)_{x}(v,v) = (g_s')_x(v,v).$$

To conclude our proof, notice that for all $$v,w$$ tangent vectors we have

$$ \begin{split}
(g_s')(v,v) + 2(g_s')(v,w) + (g_s')(w,w) = (g_s')(v+w,v+w) \\
= g_s(v+w,v+w) = g_s(v,v) + 2g_s(v,w) + g_s(w,w).
\end{split}$$

Using the fact that $$(g_s')(v,v) = g_s(v,v)$$ and $$(g_s')(w,w) = g_s(w,w)$$, we can conclude that

$$g_s(v,w) = g_s'(v,w).$$

Thus we have a family of isometries, as desired.
