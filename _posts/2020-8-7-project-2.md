## Week 2: A Break from Speakers with Computer-Aided Design
The introductory project for Design & Fabrication was to build a rudimentary speaker (See [Project 1]()), but this week of the class was the introduction to Computer-Aided Design, or CAD. This would be an important skill cultivated throughout the rest of the course, as CAD programs let you build and model virtually in 3D for later use in 3D printing, laser cutting, etc.

I also received more training on the shop floor about the previously mentioned equipment. The laser cutter would soon be my best friend.

### Materials:
  - Computer
  - Autodesk Fusion 360 (CAD software)

Finally, we drafted a new speaker design, and reviewed the science behind their operation (see image 2).

Over the course of this week we continued learning and gaining familiarity with CAD design, creating joints, boxes, and tangential projects.
