In this post, I described what I've been doing this week.

# Personal Life

I started learning some more German. The strategy right now is to follow along in Jannach's, "German for Reading Knowledge" (Sixth Edition) and then to also try translating some math papers from german to english (with the help of my brother). Our first paper we're translating (or at least attempting to) is Riemann's paper, "On the Quantity of Prime Numbers Under a Given Value." When finished, I'll post that. You can find the solutions to exercises from the first week [here](https://marshareb.github.io/files/German_exercises/week_1.pdf).

Along with that, I've recently added some notes from my summer courses (seen [here](https://marshareb.github.io/files/Dynamics.pdf) and [here](https://marshareb.github.io/files/Functional_Analysis.pdf)). I decided that, in lieu of posting my usual blurb on what I've been thinking about, I'll just post these. Next week I should pick up with the last weekly update for the summer semester.
