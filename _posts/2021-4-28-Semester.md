In this post, I talk a bit about the semester.

# Semester

Yet another long semester. This one seemed a little better than the last -- maybe I'm actually getting used to the online experience? Luckily things are looking up more. I've just received my second vaccination and will be able to go back to in-person classes in the fall.

This semester I took a course on smooth ergodic theory as well as a course in Teichmuller theory. Most of the work in the latter course was in presentations, and I don't think my presentation notes make great notes, so I won't be posting much about that at all. I did, however, have a write up for the first course which I'm pretty proud of. You can find a link to that [here](/files/dossier_finaldraft.pdf). One can think of this as an improvement to my cohomological equations notes from last semester.

My plans for the summer are to sort of repeat what I did last semester. I want to sit down and work through the Guillman-Khazdan paper (see my write up above for more details) and hopefully learn more on magnetic flows. To help make things a little more structured, I hope to return to the weekly update post I did last semester, where I'll write a little blurb about what I've been working on. If I find I'm not able to do that, I hope to at least make some kind of a write up with notes on these topics. I also plan to write up some notes on one of Ratners papers (titled "Markov Splitting for U-Flows in Three Dimensional Manifolds"), so hopefully I'll have that up soon. An old student is interested in learning some measure theory (and I plan to sneak in some dynamics), so I'll either have posts or notes on what we're talking about week to week.
