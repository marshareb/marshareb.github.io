title: MA 1172 - Recitation One - Precalculus and Calculus Review
tag: [MA1172]
---

In this post, we briefly review some precalculus and calculus that will be important for the course.

# Introduction

Hi, I'm your TA. My name is James Marshall Reber. I have two last names, no hyphen. You can just call me James.

The idea behind this blog series is to collect things I've talked about in recitation in a nice format that you can reference. I'll try writing these posts ahead of time and then coming back to update them with anything we talked about. This should help you guys with taking notes/studying for the exam. This is something new I'm trying, so if you like or hate this let me know.

Resources for the class can be found [here](https://math.osu.edu/courses/math-1172) or on Carmen. We will be following the [Ximera](https://ximera.osu.edu/mooculus/calculus2) textbook. Note that you'll need to open Ximera through Carmen if you want to get credit for an assignment.

While it's expected that you have taken Calculus before, I understand math might not be a priority in your life. If at any time you feel overwhelmed or completely lost, **please let me know**. Even if you don't have a direct question, it helps me know where you're at and lets me try to help you build a plan to get caught back up.

Today we will be covering review material. **This is not indicative of what future material will be like**. In fact, this should be easy.
- If this is so easy you are falling asleep, don't skip out on future recitations. Things are going to ramp up exponentially fast.
- If this is so hard you don't understand anything I am saying, you should reach out to me **now**. We need to get ahead of this since things are going to get hard soon.

With this out of the way, let's dive into some review. Note that we will not get through all of the review (and even this will not be comprehensive), but this hopefully gets you back into the mindset of doing math.

# Precalculus

## Functions

The most important thing here is the concept of a function. A [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) is an assignment of elements (or objects) in such a way that one object doesn't get assigned to two things. We will (generally) not work with this level of abstraction in this class, and functions for us will be assignments of numbers to numbers (whatever numbers are). The collection of elements that we can plug into the function is called the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)), and the collection of objects that the function achieves (or gets mapped onto) is called the [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)). We write $$f : D \rightarrow R$$ to indicate that $$f$$ is a function which takes objects from $$D$$ as inputs and outputs things in $$R$$.

**Example:** An easy example is the function $$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ given by $$f(x) = x^2$$. This takes a number $$x$$ and outputs that number squared. Notice that
- the range of the function is $$[0,\infty)$$; we never get a negative number as the output,
- the domain of the function is all real numbers.

(Here, $$\mathbb{R}$$ is a fancy way of writing real numbers. The definition of a real number is hard to get into, but you can look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) if you want to see more.)

Given two functions $$f : D \rightarrow R$$ and $$g : R \rightarrow H$$, we can define their [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition) by

$$ g \circ f(x) := g(f(x)).$$

This says to take $$x$$ in $$D$$ and apply $$f$$, then take that output and plug it into $$g$$. Notice this gives us a new function $$g \circ f : D \rightarrow H$$.

A function is **one-to-one** if for any two inputs $$x$$ and $$y$$ with $$x \neq y$$ we have $$f(x) \neq f(y)$$. Another way of saying this is if $$f(x) = f(y)$$, then we **must** have $$f(x) = f(y)$$.

**Example:** Consider the functions $$f,g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ given by $$f(x) = x^2$$ and $$g(x) = x$$.
- The function $$f$$ is *not* one-to-one, because

$$f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1 = 1^2 = f(1).$$

- The function $$g$$ *is* one-to-one, because

$$ g(x) = x = y = g(y),$$

so $$g(x) = g(y)$$ implies $$x = y$$.

Let $$f : D \rightarrow R$$ be a function. A function $$g : R \rightarrow D$$ is said to be the **inverse** of $$f$$ if $$g \circ f(x) = x = g \circ f(x)$$. We denote an inverse function by $$f^{-1}(x)$$ -- pay attention though, this is not the same thing as $$(f(x))^{-1}$$. An important property of one-to-one functions is the following:

**Fact:** If a function is one-to-one, then we can define an inverse function on its range.

Try to think about why this is true.

**Example:** Consider the function $$f(x) = 2x + 1$$ on the real numbers.
- If $$f(x) = f(y)$$, then $$2x + 1 = 2y + 1$$, and we can use algebra to see that $$x = y$$. The function is one-to-one.
- Let $$y$$ be any real number. We claim there is a real number $$x$$ so that $$f(x) = y$$; in other words, the range of $$f(x)$$ is all real numbers. To find the number $$x$$, we have to solve

$$f(x) = 2x+1 = y.$$

Rearranging, we find

$$ x = \frac{y-1}{2}.$$

So $$f \left( \frac{y-1}{2}\right) = y$$ (you should test this yourself).

- Since the function is one-to-one, we can use the above fact to get that there is an inverse function. Notice in the previous bulletpoint we have constructed the inverse function. It will be

$$ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x-1}{2}.$$

**Example:** Consider the function $$f(x) = x^2$$. As we pointed out earlier, this function is not one-to-one on $$\mathbb{R}$$ since $$f(-1) = f(1)$$. However, it is one-to-one on $$[0,\infty)$$. If we restrict the domain, so we consider

$$ f : [0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \ \ f(x) = x^2,$$

then we can define an inverse function. This will be the **square root**, which we write by

$$ f^{-1}(x) = x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x}.$$

There are many more important things one should talk about when it comes to functions, but we'll leave it here for now.

## Polynomials and Rational Functions

Our favorite example of a function is a polynomial. A function $$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is a **polynomial** if we can find real numbers $$a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$$ (with $$a_n \neq 0$$) so that for each real number $$x$$ we have

$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i.$$

(Here, $$\Sigma$$ is the Greek letter "sigma." If you don't remember what this notation is, we'll come back to it later.)

If we can write $$f$$ in the above form, then we say that $$f(x)$$ has **degree** $$n$$.

We say that a function $$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is a **rational function** if there are two polynomials $$p(x)$$ and $$q(x)$$ so that $$f(x) = p(x)/q(x)$$. Note that this is a little bit of a lie -- the way we wrote it implies that $$f(x)$$ has domain $$\mathbb{R}$$, but it is not defined when $$q(x) = 0$$.

## Trigonometric Functions
