# Personal Life

I thought I might get a little bit of work done, but vacation has been a nice repreieve. I'll pick back up with my usual posts next week. I think I'm going to start reading "A Primer on Mapping Class Groups," to participate in a reading course this summer, but that will be more casual compared to my other two readings. Otherwise, things are going well.
